  "description": "Rosa says: “I think we’ve all been at a snapping point, where it felt like there’s no way out and that the entire world is just crumbling down around you. You start questioning everything, including yourself. I have been there. And what I realized was that I had the strength to shape my reality – it just took getting out of my own way and finding inner-peace. It’s all about self-love and accepting that you are enough. Writing “Snap” was a form of therapy for me and I hope that it can be that for others who are also going through hard times.\"\n\n~~~~~ Credits ~~~~~\n\n\"Snap\"\nWritten by: Rosa Linn, Larzz Principato, Courtney Harrell, Allie Crystal, Tamar Mardirossian Kaprelian, Jeremy Dusoulet\nProduced by: Alex Salibian, Ethan Schneiderman, Larzz Principato, Ben Samama, Lilith Navasardyan\nMixing by: Tony Maseratti\n\n\"Snap\" music video\nDirector: Aramayis Hayrapetyan \nDOP: Yuriy Nikogosov \nProduction Designer: Albert Grigoryan \nLine Producer: Armen Sargsyan \nSecond Director: Suren Safaryan \nAssistant Director: Anush Hakobyan \nStylist:  Armen Galyan \nGaffer: Geras Velikhanyan \nEditing: Aramayis Hayrapetyan \nCG: Andranik Torosyan \nColor Correction: Karen Melkumyan\nProduced by: Gravity Production\n\n~~~~~ Lyrics ~~~~~\n\nVERSE 1\nIt’s 4 am \nI can’t turn my head off \nWishing these memories would fade \nThey never do \nTurns out people lied \nThey said just snap your fingers\nAs if it was really that easy \nFor me to get over you \n\nPRE - CHORUS\nI just need time \n\nCHORUS \nSnappin' 1, 2, where are you? \nYou’re still in my heart\nSnappin 3, 4, don’t need you here anymore\nGet out of my heart \n‘Cause I might snap \n\nVERSE 2\nI’m writing a song\nSaid this is the last one \nBut how many last songs are left? \nI’m losing count\nSince June 22\nMy heart’s been on fire\nI’ve been spending my nights \nIn the rain trying to put it out \n\nCHORUS \nSo I’m snappin 1, 2, where are you? \nYou’re still in my heart\nSnappin 3, 4, don’t need you here anymore\nGet out of my heart \n‘Cause I might snap \n\nOh-oh, Cause I might snap\nOh-oh\n\nBRIDGE\nAnd if one more person says you should get over it \nOh I might stop talking to people before I snap, snap, snap \nOh I might stop talking to people before I snap\n\nCHORUS \nSnappin 1, 2, where are you?
